# CapitalCreations.github.io
This set of files is a future web site for Capital Creations LLC. As of 230315, it is almost entirely built using Bootstrap. There is only one javascript function which is used to help troubleshoot index.html when needed, but only when needed
As of 230315, this is a work in progress. There are problems:

1) Can not view the embedded video because (I think) of size limitions. This video works in my local environment but not online. 
2) I did not upload to YouTube, since (see below) I am not seeking a job
3) There are formatting, appearance and dead link issues in this site, all of which are part of the "Work in Progress" moniker
This is an ongoing project with months to go before it is ready to go live

Note to MIT Staff: I am not a student that is seeking employment. Rather, I am a retired guy with a ton of entrepreneurial experience
and very little "online and cloud" experience. I started a non-profit business whose goal is to help disadvantaged young people build
succesful businesses. I am not sure what role github might play in this endeavor, but I don't see me sharing code. I am learning how
to build websites so that the young entrepreneurs can leverage them in their marketing. I've been in businesses for over 40 years,
And I don't have a website! My immediate goal for the class is to understand end-to-end structure of the web and to learn how to 
build websites. I'm starting with this site, for a business I have owned for over 30 years, and once I get this one working, I plan
to use what I have learned to integrate online marketing and sales with conventional marketing and sales to help my clients sell 
their products and services
