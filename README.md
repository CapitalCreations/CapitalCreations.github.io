# CapitalCreations.github.io
This set of files is a future web site for Capital Creations LLC. As of 230315, it is almost entirely built using Bootstrap. There is only one javascript function which is used to help troubleshoot index.html when needed, but only when needed
As of 230315, this is a work in progress. As a work in progress, note:

1) The navigation links are, in almost all cases, dead links. As I develop my programming skills and define the website requirements, these will be addressed
2) There are a number of formatting issues mostly related to devices. IE if visiting the site using a cell phone, the experience is not as satisfying as if viewed on a desktop. These issues are being addressed
3) The entire website is an "undesigned" project ... meaning it is relevent to how I want the site to work but is intended as to be, first and foremost, an exercise in using the front end tools of Bootstrap, javascript, CSS and HTML to construct a working website
